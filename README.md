The "COMMON" Dictionary
================================

This repository is a fork of the Webster's Unabridged English Dictionary with words that don't start with "c" removed.

The original dictionary can be found in plain text form [here](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29765).
This is forked from [adambom/dictionary](https://github.com/adambom/dictionary) which has the original JSON version of the dictionary.


_Did you know: Removing all the words that don't start with "c" reduces the length of the dictionary by 91%. I really thought it would be more_
